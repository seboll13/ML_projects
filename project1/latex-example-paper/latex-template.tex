  Implement basic Machine Learning methods on a given data set and analyze the predictions from it.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The goal of this first mini project is to implement all basic Machine Learning methods on a given data set and analyze the results we obtained from running these algorithms. Essentially, the demanded algorithms were:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Linear regression using Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient descent
  \item Least squares regression and ridge regression using normal equations
  \item Logistic regression using Gradient Descent
  \item Regularized logistic regression using Gradient Descent
\end{enumerate}

\section{Algorithms implementation details}

\subsection{Linear regression}
This first algorithm is essential to Machine Learning. It consists of taking a data set that often contains two different data point types and split them using a line described by a linear function in order to divide the points the best way possible. We have performed two different implementations of it: one using Gradient Descent and the other one using Stochastic Gradient Descent.\par
Note that the Gradient Descent implementation does not work due to the fact that we are treating a big amount of data, so the Stochastic Gradient Descent will help us resolve that problem by only taking a batch of for example 50 randomly selected data samples.\par
If we only import the data as it is, we have a problem: the loss function does not converge. To resolve the problem, we essentially have to standardize the data, that is given a variable $X$, we compute the value $Y=(X-\mu)/\sigma$ where $\mu$ is the computed mean and $\sigma$ the standard deviation.
