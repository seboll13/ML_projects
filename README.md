# Project 2
- The code for the project is contained in the ```project2``` folder.
- The folder contains the following sub-folders:
  - ```data``` in which all scripts required to generate data are and another sub-folder in which all images generated will be stored.
  - ```report``` in which our report tex and pdf files are stored along with the bib file and the images used in the report.
  - ```models``` in which the models used will be stored when running the main python code.
- It also contains the main python program ```run.py``` along with two other scripts ```display_losses.py``` and ```display_test_results.py``` that we created to generate plots of the data we trained for an easier visual representation.
